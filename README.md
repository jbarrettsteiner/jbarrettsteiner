### Hi 👋

<!--
**jbarrettsteiner/jbarrettsteiner** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Jacob. You can mostly find me on [Homer](https://homer.github.io/), where I work on the [Product team](https://homer.github.io/crew).

I also sometimes share stories on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jbarrettsteiner/), or from time to time on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/jbarrettsteiner).

- 🔭 I’m currently focused on supporting developers creating [Homer APIs](https://homer.github.io/crew).
- 💬 I help to look after the [Homer Creator // Slack Community](https://twittercommunity.com), and you will also find me answering questions on the [Homer ShipLog Twitter](https://twitter.com/homersocial).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Español and guitar
